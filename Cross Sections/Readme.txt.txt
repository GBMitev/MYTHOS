Photoabsorption.csv contains the photoabsorption cross sections for T between 100 K and 8000 K in steps of 100 K
	Columns - First column is wavenumbers, after that columns are labelled by temperature eg. 
		wavenumbers, 100, 200, 300, 400, …, 7700, 7800, 7900, 8000

Photodissociation.csv contains the photodissociation cross sections for T between 100 K and 8000 K in steps of 100 K
	Columns - First column is wavelength, after that columns are labelled by temperature eg. 
		wavelength, 100, 200, 300, 400, …, 7700, 7800, 7900, 8000
